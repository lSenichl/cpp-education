But what a burden is to walk amid
The men, as though I were not ended,
And to narrate to those who’ve yet not lived
Of passions tragically blended,

And, looking deeply into my nightmare,
To find law in the lawless swirling feeling -
So that the raging deadly fire of living
May show through art’s pale-colored glare.
